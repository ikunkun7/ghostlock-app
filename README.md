# GhostLock-App

> 中文: [README_ZH.md](README_ZH.md)

## Documentation

- [Kernel Profile Porting Guide](docs/kernel_profiles/README.md) - add support for a new kernel. GhostLock matches kernels by exact `uname -r` and rejects unsupported builds, showing the status at the top. Built-in profiles live in `app/src/main/assets/kernel_profiles/`: one HOCON file per release, `index.conf` as the runtime index, and `<major.minor>-template.conf` version-family templates.
- [Supported devices](docs/kernel_profiles/SUPPORTED_DEVICES.md) - the built-in kernel list.
- [Shared execution defaults](docs/kernel_profiles/defaults.md) - every execution-tuning field, its default, and why.
- [Profile schema](docs/kernel_profiles/PROFILE_SCHEMA.md) - full profile structure and data flow.
- [Adding a component](docs/development/adding-a-component.md) - developer guide for a new native middleware / backend / frontend (Chinese).

For the complete device-porting workflow, kernel-family template links, and tuning rationale, see the [Kernel Profile Porting Guide](docs/kernel_profiles/README.md).

Rows explicitly marked **Shizuku required** run through a shell UserService. Start Shizuku with ADB and tap the status card to grant access; all other rows use the app's normal execution path.

## Quick Start

Open **GhostLock** and tap **Run**. KernelSU (`me.weishu.kernelsu`), ReSukiSU (`com.resukisu.resukisu`), KowSU (`com.kowx712.supermanager`), or SevenK (`com.sevenk.core`) provides `ksud` for module loading; without it, W1/W2 still grant uid 0 but no module is loaded.

The execution chain is a pipeline of three components: a frontend (`root_child` startup/handoff), a backend (the CVE-2026-43499 futex primitive), and a middleware route. The catalogued combinations are instantiated at build time; the resolved profile selects which one runs. The route races two cores: on the 6.6/6.12 tree-waiter kernels the main thread hammers `select` while a consumer thread perturbs the waiter's priority; on the 6.1 compact-waiter kernels it drives `getsockopt(TCP_ZEROCOPY_RECEIVE)` through a punched-hole page; the 5.15 kernels use the multicast waiter. The CPU pair also comes from the resolved profile.

## Command-Line Debugging

adb/shell has no seccomp filter, so W3 is skipped - handy for quick verification:

```powershell
make -C src ghostlock
./gradlew exportKernelProfiles
adb push build/native/ghostlock /data/local/tmp/ghostlock
adb push build/kernel-profiles/<release>.bin /data/local/tmp/profile.bin
adb shell chmod 755 /data/local/tmp/ghostlock
adb shell /data/local/tmp/ghostlock --load-prebuilt-profile /data/local/tmp/profile.bin
```

## Offset Extraction

`tools/extract_rs` derives offsets from a `boot.img` (plus optional `xbl_config.img`), a full OTA ZIP, or an `http(s)` URL pointing at one. kallsyms come from `--kallsyms` or are recovered from the image's embedded table. `pselect_waiter_shift` and `off_slide_loggers_0_1` are derived by the built-in arm64 disassembler. MediaTek images have no `xbl_config.img` and usually no BTF: the physical load address is derived from kallsyms `_text` (override with `--phys`).

```powershell
Push-Location tools/extract_rs
cargo build --release
Pop-Location
build/extract/release/ghostlock-extract.exe boot.img --xbl-config xbl_config.img --format conf --out profile.conf
build/extract/release/ghostlock-extract.exe OTA.zip --format conf --out profile.conf
```

`--format conf` is the extractor output: a flattened, self-contained profile (no `include` lines, the shared 6.x credential/KernelSnitch constants inlined, the route selected from `--analysis` evidence unless `--route` overrides it). The extractor emits every field the image actually yields and omits the rest; it never fills gaps from a neighbouring kernel family's guesses (unverified-family 6.6, the default `-2`, the 5.15 multicast constants, or a phys default). Every output is an **unverified candidate**: importable and parseable, with missing or invalid fields blocked by the app's pre-execution validation, so a successful run never implies device support. On 5.x it also derives the credential reference repair from `init_cred` and the multicast geometry from BTF (see `docs/analysis/extractor-5x-derivation-plan.md`). `--format json` stays for the v1 import path. To add a built-in profile, complete and validate the matching version-family template, save it as a standalone `.conf` profile, and add it to `kernel_profiles/index.conf`. The old C `offsets.h` registry is deprecated and removed.

### MediaTek

MediaTek images have no `xbl_config.img` and usually no embedded BTF, so the
extractor cannot derive the two physical addresses (`kernel_phys_load`,
`kernel_phys_offset`) from the image and leaves them `null`. The runtime then
falls back to the SoC formula, which fails at W1 on MediaTek. Fill both by
running the separate `tools/mtk-phys/` extractor on a rooted device (it reads
`/proc/iomem`) and pasting the values into the app's advanced overrides. See
[MEDIATEK.md](docs/kernel_profiles/MEDIATEK.md).

### Preflight

The extractor disassembles `remove_waiter()` before extracting offsets. Kernels with the fix are rejected with exit code `6`; only vulnerable kernels continue.

### On-device analysis

A full OTA can be analyzed entirely on the phone: `boot` plus `xbl_config`
are extracted automatically. Pass `--work-dir` an app-writable dir when
running inside the app sandbox. Cross-compile and push:

```powershell
rustup target add aarch64-linux-android
$ndk = "$env:ANDROID_HOME\ndk\<version>\toolchains\llvm\prebuilt\windows-x86_64\bin"
$env:CC_aarch64_linux_android = "$ndk\aarch64-linux-android35-clang.cmd"
$env:AR_aarch64_linux_android = "$ndk\llvm-ar.exe"
$env:CARGO_TARGET_AARCH64_LINUX_ANDROID_LINKER = $env:CC_aarch64_linux_android
Push-Location tools/extract_rs
cargo build --release --target aarch64-linux-android
Pop-Location
adb push build/extract/aarch64-linux-android/release/ghostlock-extract /data/local/tmp/
adb shell /data/local/tmp/ghostlock-extract /sdcard/OTA.zip
```

### Importing offsets without rebuilding the app

New kernels no longer need an app rebuild: tap **Import offsets.conf (HOCON)**
and pick the extractor's flattened `.conf`, or use **Import offsets.json (v1)**
for an older JSON report. v1 JSON is converted in-app, so nothing has to be
pushed to the device: native always starts from the GLK1 document the app sends
on stdin, and matches the current `uname -r` against the resolved profile
before rejecting the kernel. Imports merge across files; a release already
stored prompts before overwrite.

The app can also generate the profile itself — **Parse OTA link** (full OTA ZIP
URL) and **Parse image** (`boot.img` + optional `xbl_config.img`) run the
extractor in-process and write a flattened `.conf` into the app data dir on
success:

```hocon
# GhostLock kernel profile: 6.12.38-android16-5-g844001fb8721-ab14552068-4k (HOCON, self-contained).
